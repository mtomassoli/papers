# My papers/tutorials

#### Modern Windows Exploit Development.pdf

This is a full book about *Hacking*. You need to know *assembly* and be somewhat comfortable with kernel debuggers and disassemblers. I try to explain everything from scratch except for assembly (because many tutorials about it are already available).

~~You can find the original posts the book is a compilation of on [my site](http://expdev-kiuhnm.rhcloud.com/).~~

***Update***: The website is down, but all the material is finally available [here](https://github.com/mtomassoli/expdev).

#### backprop.pdf (*backpropagation*)

This is a thorough introduction to *backpropagation* as used in Machine Learning.

#### inftheory.pdf (*Information Theory for Machine Learning*)

This is a tutorial I wrote to solidify my understanding of basic *Information Theory* and can be used as a thorough and reasoned (i.e. everything is motivated) introduction to Information Theory especially for Machine Learning.

#### matrixcalculus.pdf

This is a tutorial about *Matrix Calculus* presenting Magnus and Neudecker's approach to Matrix Differential Calculus.

#### tensor_diff_calc.pdf

This is a tutorial about a novel approach to *Matrix Calculus* using *Tensors* which intends to be a *simplification* (at least on a conceptual level) of the approach reviewed in matrixcalculus.pdf.
